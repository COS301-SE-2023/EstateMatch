<details><summary>Dharshan Gopaul (u21637386)</summary><br>
<p>
Dharshan is a BSC Information and Knowledge Systems student with a Data Science background. He likes to work in groups since he knows that there is always someone to help and there is always someone that can help him. He has worked in Java, SQL,  C++ and Python. His strong suit is working with database queries, dealing with backend code and creating designs for the frontend. He is still learning how to successfully integrate frontend with backend. His knowledge about frontend frameworks is not as great as his backend skills.  Although this is the case, he enjoys learning new technologies and is committed to master the technologies required.
